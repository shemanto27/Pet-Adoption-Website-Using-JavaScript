# Pet Adoption Center

A responsive web application that allows users to explore and adopt pets. The project fetches pet data from an API and provides options for categorization, viewing details, adding favorites, and sorting pets based on price. The app is built with modern web development practices, including ES6 features.

## Key Features

1. **Category-based Pet Filtering**: Users can view pets based on categories like breed or type.
2. **Pet Details Modal**: Clicking the details button opens a modal with complete information about the pet.
3. **Favorite Pets Sidebar**: Users can add pets to a favorites section, displayed in a side panel.
4. **Adoption Modal**: Adopting a pet triggers a countdown modal, and the pet is marked as "Adopted."
5. **Sort by Price**: Users can sort pets from highest to lowest price.

## ES6 Features Used

- **Arrow functions**: For cleaner syntax in function declarations.
- **Template literals**: For dynamically generating HTML content.
- **Async/await**: For handling asynchronous API calls.
- **Array methods**: `forEach()`, `sort()`, etc., for handling pet data.
- **Destructuring assignment**: For handling API responses efficiently.
